<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who meet the above PSLE
MTL grade criteria may choose to offer MTL at a less demanding level if
they prefer. However, we recommend that these students initially pursue
MTL at the highest level (aligned with their posting group) and try the
subject for at least one year before deciding to switch to a less demanding
level. A Parents Gateway (PG) notification with additional details will
be sent to the parents of eligible students.</p>
