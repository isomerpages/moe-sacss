# EDUCATION SUPPORT

In 2021, the Education Support Committee carried out a series of professional development sessions to equip teachers with skills to support and manage students with learning needs.

Teachers are introduced to executive functions which are a set of mental skills that we use to learn and carry out daily tasks. Executive functions are associated with higher academic performance and are important life skills for our students and these strategies are integrated into our teaching and interaction with our girls. In 2021, our teachers focused on metacognition and sustained attention and inhibitory control.

Teachers are also introduced to a range of gadgets and equipment that can help students focus. To provide holistic support to students with Special Educational Needs to achieve their full potential, sessions on inclusive practices are periodically shared with our educators.
