# SELF-STUDY PROGRAMME

The self-study programme was started to provide low performing students with a conducive place to study. The girls are provided with air-conditioned facilities and food. This programme is intended to help both lower and upper secondary students acquire study skills like prioritising their work and planning revision schedules. Students can either sign up for the programme or are nominated by their form teachers or subject teachers. The programme is monitored by the Year Heads and Assistant Year Heads in both the lower and upper secondary levels. While this programme began as a self-study and independent learning programme, it has since evolved and there are subject teachers on duty at specific times of the year to help students develop and enhance the content and skills of the subject. The ultimate goal of the programme is to teach self-discipline and independence through a tripartite relationship between the school, the parents and the girls.
