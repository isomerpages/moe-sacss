Between 2021 and 2022, the school launched **four** new sources of financial assistance, three of which were generously sponsored by members of our Canossian Family – Ms Ng Wee Chew, the late Mrs Thio Ying Ying and the late Ms Grace Chew and one was sponsored by an anonymous donor. In the form of an award, a bursary and an emergency fund, these serve to inspire and encourage our students who have continued to give their best in the different areas of their school life, in spite of the personal difficulties they face.

**The Magdalenian Education Grant**

This award, established in 2022, is a need based grant programme providing one-time financial assistance to Singaporean and non-Singaporean graduates of SACSS to complete a full-time NITEC certification or polytechnic diploma that develop their skills for employment in the area of social services which in turn, contributes to the dignity and well-being of society, including children and youth, people with disabilities and special needs, and seniors. The Magdalenian Education Grant seeks to extend St. Magdalene’s mission by empowering our students from less privileged homes to give back to society by funding their post-secondary education. Their services can thereafter support the poor, the marginalised and the sick.

**Canossian Good Progress Award**

The Canossian Good Progress Award aims to recognise students who have shown resilience and made good progress in their academic work, despite the challenges they face in their daily lives. It also serves as an encouragement to the recipients, to embody the school spirit of compassion and charity for others. Sponsored by Ms Ng Wee Chew, an SACSS alumnus, this award is in memory of her grandmother Mdm Quek Ai Boi. Ms Ng hopes the award will recognise students who have shown the same resilient and charitable nature demonstrated by Mdm Quek. This award is given to one student from each level of Secondary 1 to Secondary 3.

**Thio Ying Ying Bursary**

The Thio Ying Ying Bursary serves to dignify and encourage active volunteerism in students from low-income families. Through this bursary, the school hopes to instil a sense of gratitude in our students, to inspire them to be gracious and to strive for greater achievements benefiting themselves and the community. Sponsored by the family of the late Mrs Thio Ying Ying, an SACSS alumnus, this bursary also aims to nurture youth leaders who can adopt an entrepreneurial and innovation-focused approach to community issues through training and mentoring. An addition to the school’s Character Awards, it is open to students from Secondary 2 to Secondary 5.

**Grace Chew Compassion Fund**

The Grace Chew Compassion Fund is a crisis response financial assistance geared toward granting short-term respite to low-income families who require immediate financial aid. This timely assistance seeks to prevent disadvantaged families from spiralling into poverty or developing other chronic family issues that may impact the students’ schooling. Sponsored by our late Vice-Principal (Administration), Ms Grace Chew, this award is in honour of her great sense of compassion to the vulnerable, as well as her indomitable fighting spirit in the face of her illness. This fund is open to all students in SACSS.

**SACSS Care Fund**

From time to time, lower income families experience protracted hardships due to sudden changes in the external environment. The SACSS Care Fund serves to provide short to medium-term additional financial aid to students in SACSS who are under the school’s financial assistance schemes. This fund will support families for a period of 3 months or 6 months per application, for up to 3 years, depending on the home situation.
