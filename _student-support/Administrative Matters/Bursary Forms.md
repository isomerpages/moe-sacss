<p>Between 2021 and 2022, the school launched&nbsp;<strong>four</strong>&nbsp;new
sources of financial assistance, three of which were generously sponsored
by members of our Canossian Family – Ms Ng Wee Chew, the late Mrs Thio
Ying Ying and the late Ms Grace Chew and one was sponsored by an anonymous
donor. In the form of an award, a bursary and an emergency fund, these
serve to inspire and encourage our students who have continued to give
their best in the different areas of their school life, in spite of the
personal difficulties they face.</p>
<p><strong>Thio Ying Ying Bursary</strong>
</p>
<p>The Thio Ying Ying Bursary serves to dignify and encourage active volunteerism
in students from low-income families. Through this bursary, the school
hopes to instil a sense of gratitude in our students, to inspire them to
be gracious and to strive for greater achievements benefiting themselves
and the community. Sponsored by the family of the late Mrs Thio Ying Ying,
an SACSS alumnus, this bursary also aims to nurture youth leaders who can
adopt an entrepreneurial and innovation-focused approach to community issues
through training and mentoring. An addition to the school’s Character Awards,
it is open to students from Secondary 2 to Secondary 5.</p>

<p><strong>Grace Chew Compassion Fund</strong>
</p>
<p>The Grace Chew Compassion Fund is a crisis response financial assistance
geared toward granting short-term respite to low-income families who require
immediate financial aid. This timely assistance seeks to prevent disadvantaged
families from spiralling into poverty or developing other chronic family
issues that may impact the students’ schooling. Sponsored by our late Vice-Principal
(Administration), Ms Grace Chew, this award is in honour of her great sense
of compassion to the vulnerable, as well as her indomitable fighting spirit
in the face of her illness. This fund is open to all students in SACSS.</p>

<p><strong>SACSS Care Fund</strong>
</p>
<p>From time to time, lower income families experience protracted hardships
due to sudden changes in the external environment. The SACSS Care Fund
serves to provide short to medium-term additional financial aid to students
in SACSS who are under the school’s financial assistance schemes. This
fund will support families for a period of 3 months or 6 months per application,
for up to 3 years, depending on the home situation.</p>
