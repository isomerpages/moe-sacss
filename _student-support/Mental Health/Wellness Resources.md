# WELLNESS RESOURCES

Nobody talks about the moments in their secondary experiences that were low or made them feel vulnerable. Failing the first exam or feeling alone. In reality, these are normal and common experiences. None of these are experiences that you have to handle by yourself. If you ever need help in school, do approach your teachers or the School Counsellors. If you are unable to get in touch with your teachers or school personnel after school hours, here are some additional support resources available to you.
