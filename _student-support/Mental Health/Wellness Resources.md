<p>Nobody talks about the moments in their secondary experiences that were
low or made them feel vulnerable. Failing the first exam or feeling alone.
In reality, these are normal and common experiences. None of these are
experiences that you have to handle by yourself. If you ever need help
in school, do approach your teachers or the School Counsellors. If you
are unable to get in touch with your teachers or school personnel after
school hours, here are some additional support resources available to you.</p>
