<p>Being a teenager is an amazing experience, but it can also be a little
overwhelming at times for some. Here at SACSS, no matter what you are going
through, we are here to help.</p>
<p>The SACSS Wellbeing Team brings together a group of three remarkable counsellors
to support our students in finding successful strategies to manage and
overcome issues that may crop up in the life of teenagers. Besides referral
by teachers, students are free to walk in and speak with any one of the
three school counsellors.</p>
<p><strong>During office hours, from 8.30 am to 5.00 pm, you may call our main line at 64490616 to make an appointment with our counsellors.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively, you may also walk into the St Raphael Wellness Centre to fill in a self-referral form to seek an appointment with the school counsellors.</strong>
</p>

<p>Good mental health is not just about talking to a counsellor or therapist.
Our Form Teachers regularly conduct one-on-one wellbeing conversations
with our students. During these sessions, girls are empowered to identify
their values, and to learn how to effectively balance all aspects of their
spirituality, health, learning and relationships. Eating healthy, getting
enough sleep, and exercising are also important habits that will help improve
oneâ€™s mental health.</p>
