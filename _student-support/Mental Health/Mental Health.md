Being a teenager is an amazing experience, but it can also be a little overwhelming at times for some. Here at SACSS, no matter what you are going through, we are here to help.

The SACSS Wellbeing Team brings together a group of three remarkable counsellors to support our students in finding successful strategies to manage and overcome issues that may crop up in the life of teenagers. Besides referral by teachers, students are free to walk in and speak with any one of the three school counsellors.

**During office hours, from 8.30 am to 5.00 pm, you may call our main line at 64490616 to make an appointment with our counsellors.**

**Alternatively, you may also walk into the St Raphael Wellness Centre to fill in a self-referral form to seek an appointment with the school counsellors.**

Our Counsellors: 
* Ms Gayathri Devi Kaneson (Full Time School Counsellor) [[gayathri_devi_kaneson@moe.edu.sg](gayathri_devi_kaneson@moe.edu.sg)]
* Ms Rachael Goh (Full Time School Counsellor) [[goh_cai_yun_rachael@moe.edu.sg](goh_cai_yun_rachael@moe.edu.sg)]
* Mdm Christine Lim (Flexi Adjunct School Counsellor) [[christine_lim_peck_sim@moe.edu.sg](christine_lim_peck_sim@moe.edu.sg)]



Good mental health is not just about talking to a counsellor or therapist. Our Form Teachers regularly conduct one-on-one wellbeing conversations with our students. During these sessions, girls are empowered to identify their values, and to learn how to effectively balance all aspects of their spirituality, health, learning and relationships. Eating healthy, getting enough sleep, and exercising are also important habits that will help improve oneâ€™s mental health.
