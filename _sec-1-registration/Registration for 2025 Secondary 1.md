<p>Students who meet the above PSLE MTL grade criteria may choose to offer
MTL at a less demanding level if they prefer. However, we recommend that
these students initially pursue MTL at the highest level (aligned with
their posting group) and try the subject for at least one year before deciding
to switch to a less demanding level. A Parents Gateway (PG) notification
with additional details will be sent to the parents of eligible students.&nbsp;</p>
