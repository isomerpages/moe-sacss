**What is Anxiety?**

Anxiety, similar to fear, is part of our body's natural defense system. Anxiety is our body's way of warning us that something is not right. It occurs when we think something bad, dangerous, or scary is about to happen, and that there is nothing we can do about it. Anxiety becomes problematic when it prevents us from functioning appropriately in a particular situation. Those with anxiety often worry excessively about the future or imagined scenarios in their minds.

Extreme forms of anxiety include panic attacks, which may cause shortness of breath elevated heartbeat, sweaty palms, and dizziness. This condition can be debilitating and prevents us from functioning normally.
