Coping with Changes
-------------------

**What is it?**

Change can come in many forms. It can be moving to this school from a different one, changing classes, taking on new responsibilities as a student leader, making new friends, or even moving house. Change can often be difficult to handle because it takes us out of our comfort zone and makes us uncomfortable. We can feel vulnerable and lost when our situations change. Sometimes, the new situations can be overwhelming and your emotional response may be quite intense.

**How to Cope with Changes?**

1. <u>Remember past changes</u>

It may be helpful to remember what you have been through during other changes in your life. It could be helpful to remember how you felt, and how you handled the change, and what you learnt from the experience. The situation may be different now, but if you were previously confronted with new situations, it is very likely that you may have similar reactions. This will provide you with the reassurance that the situation will not last forever and you will get over it.

2. <u>Take stock and check your thoughts</u>

It is important to take stock and check that our thoughts actually make sense. A lot of the time we get caught in a downward spiral of the “what ifs” which, when viewed rationally are unlikely to make sense. This can lead to a self-sabotaging situation.  What would be most useful is to take a step back and ask ourselves these questions:

*   Is this likely to ever happen?
*   Has this ever happened to me before?
*   What’s the worst that could possibly happen? Can I handle that?  
    

3. <u>Talk to someone</u>

Talk to a friend, teacher, or family member about what you are feeling and how you are coping with the change. By talking it through with someone, you will also be able to analyse your feelings and understand your own reaction to the change, and you may possibly get some additional help.
