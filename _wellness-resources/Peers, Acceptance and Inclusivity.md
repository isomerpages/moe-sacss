**What is Relationship Management?**

Friends play an extremely important role in the lives of teenagers. Teens seek acceptance from their peers and often emulate what their friends or cultural idols are doing to be accepted as part of a group.

While this can be healthy, it sometimes leads to teens going astray. Some may exhibit behaviour issues such as disobedience or rebelliousness, and others may pick up negative habits like smoking or shoplifting. The reasons for such rebelliousness are sometimes caused by the desire to fir into a particular group or due to peer influence. These activities may result in grades slipping at school and conflict with parents at home.

**What can you do?**

1. <u>Reflect on the nature of this relationship</u>

Take some time to reflect on the nature of the relationship you have with your friends and ask yourself if you are getting what you want out of them. No relationship is perfect and some things may need to be worked on. However, you need to think about how healthy the relationship is and ask yourself if you feel safe in this relationship and if there is mutual respect.

While all relationships are different, there are a few key aspects of healthy relationships:

*   Should be based on equality, respect and trust.
*   Shouldn’t be any imbalance in the relationship.
*   Should work to address any imbalances in the relationship.

2. <u>Talk to a trusted adult</u>

This could be a parent or another relative or older friend that you are close to. They will guide you in finding the right influences in your life.

3. <u>Diversify your friend circle</u>

Take up activities to make new friends, even if is uncomfortable at first. This may help you find people that will exert a positive influence on you.
