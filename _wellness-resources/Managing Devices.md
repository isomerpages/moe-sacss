Managing Devices
----------------

**What is meant by this?**

Many of us spend much of our free time on our devices. We surf the web, use social media, watch videos, order food, look for directions, check bus arrival times, do our homework and chat with our friends using our devices.

We seem to be holding on to our devices all the time, and we rarely put them down. Sometimes, this looks like an addiction to our devices, and this could negatively impact our relationships with the people around us. It can also impact our schoolwork when we are more interested in checking social media or replying immediately to messages instead of doing our work.

Using our devices to play games or watch videos before bed can also lead to us getting less sleep than we need when we get carried away and lose track of time. Too much screen time puts strain on our eyes.

**How can I better manage devices?**

1\. Put away your devices when interacting with friends or when having a meal. Enjoy the in-person interaction without the distraction of your devices.

2\. Put your devices away half an hour before bedtime, and do a calming activity instead, like reading a book. Looking at a screen before bed will reduce the quality of your sleep.

3\. Set a limit for yourself for how much screen time you can have in a day. You may even discover a new hobby with all the extra time that you have.
