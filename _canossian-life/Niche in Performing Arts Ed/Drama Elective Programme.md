**Drama Elective & Drama O Level Programme at SACSS**

The Drama Elective Programme, launched in January 2006, marks SACSS as a pioneer in integrating drama into the curriculum and offering it as a GCE O-Level exam subject. Over the years, SACSS has consistently excelled in the O-Level Drama Programme, producing outstanding results and nurturing numerous talents.

Students demonstrating aptitude and attitude for Drama in Secondary 1, are invited to join the Drama Elective Programme at Secondary 2, where their talents are further nurtured. They delve deeper into acting skills, and movement work, and gain a comprehensive understanding of devising and scriptwriting.Â 

Upper Secondary students in the Drama O-Level Drama Programme explore various drama genres through practical workshops, learning journeys to theatres, drama theory lessons and hands-on sessions. They learn to create plays, interpret scripts, and design sets and lighting, putting their skills into practice. Additionally, they are trained in voice and movement work to enhance their performance abilities.

At SACSS, we believe that an education in the arts is essential for developing an appreciation of aesthetics. It also serves as an authentic platform to teach critical 21st-century skills such as collaboration, creativity, inventive thinking, and critical thinking. Drama recreates our lives on stage, weaving a beautiful tapestry of collective stories. This platform gives students a voice - helping them realise that their stories matter because their lives matter. What makes drama unique is its experiential learning process. Students step into different characters' shoes, experiencing various perspectives in a safe, controlled environment.

Learning through drama involves much more than acting. It encompasses collaborative group work, research, idea negotiation, production management, and rehearsals. These processes enhance the acquisition of social-emotional learning (SEL) skills and 21st-century competencies. At SACSS, we use a thematic approach to contextualise learning, selecting themes based on focused group discussions, student surveys, and analysis of student profiles to ensure relevance and engagement.

This empowering course allows students to explore and address themes and social issues that interest them, giving them a platform to voice their concerns through their creative work. Our students emerge more confident, creative, socially aware, and responsible individuals, ready to make thoughtful decisions.
