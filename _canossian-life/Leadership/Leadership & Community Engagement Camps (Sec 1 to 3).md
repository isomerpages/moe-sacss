# LEADERSHIP & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CAMPS (SEC 1 – 3)
To promote team building, resilience, peer support and problem solving, SACSS organsises the annual Orientation Camp at the start of the year and the “Camparaderie” in March for all Secondary 1 to 3 students. From archery to kayaking and high elements such as the flying fox, students are encouraged to challenge the process, persevere and overcome their fears. Each activity allows them to learn to build trust in one another and encourage others to act. Many of these learning opportunities and tasks encourage our girls to build on their existing skills and talents and combine these skills towards an assigned task or goal.

From 2021, the Orientation Camp for the Secondary 3 cohort took the focus of using an inquiry and problem solving approach to team building by infusing case studies and social issues as a way of encouraging students to work on community engagement. Students were provided with case studies and the SCAMPER framework to brainstorm possible solutions to social and community issues and presented their suggestions using a variety of multimedia platforms.
