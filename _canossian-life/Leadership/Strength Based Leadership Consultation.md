# STRENGTH-BASED LEADERSHIP CONSULTATION
#### **We Start with Your Strengths**

We believe our girls have leadership qualities. Each girl is unique and she brings her own style and strengths in her leadership journey. It is then important that our girls are aware of their own strengths and harness their strengths to bring about change. Here at SACSS, we tap on [VIA Character Strengths](/files/Canossian%20Life/YouthIconsClassifications-2021.pdf) to help our girls discover and use their strengths to empower themselves and others, improve their leadership skills, and make positive contributions. Students will learn about their top five strengths and receive a customised report to guide them in using their strengths most effectively.

#### **Individual Strengths Consultation**

Character Strengths are the positive parts of one’s personality that impact how one think, feel and behave. Scientists have identified 24 character strengths that people have the capacity to express. Upon receiving a customised report, students will receive consultation from their Form Teachers to help them to:

*   Gain self-awareness and self-understanding;
*   Develop their leadership capacity;
*   Increase their relational effectiveness; and
*   Enable a strength-based outlook towards their future academic and career
