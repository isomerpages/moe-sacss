The Secondary 2 LiT programme allows students the opportunity to nominate themselves for a common training programme to explore the concept of leadership. Building on Kouzes and Posnerâ€™s Leadership Challenge Model, these Sec 2 LITs are a little more exposed to 3 of the concepts - Model the Way, Encourage the Heart and Challenge the Process. They work on both class and community projects and are supported by their Secondary 3 peers and mentors in their CCA or in the Council. They are observed, guided and mentored throughout the year for their positive behaviours and competencies as they explore what it means to be a Canossian Leader before they move into their Secondary 3 year to take on positions within their class, their CCA, the Catholic Activities Council or the Student Council.
