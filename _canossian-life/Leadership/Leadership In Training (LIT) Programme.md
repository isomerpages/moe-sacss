**Leadership Training at Our School**

At our school, we believe that every student possesses unique strengths, abilities, and talents, enabling her to make a positive impact within her sphere of influence. We are committed to helping students discover and harness these strengths, guiding them to lead, serve, and benefit the community.

The Leader-in-Training (L-i-T) programme is a key initiative designed for selected Secondary 2 students. This programme provides a unified platform for leadership training, embodying the essence of what it means "To be a Canossian Leader." In the L-i-T programme, senior leaders mentor junior leaders, collaborating to shape their leadership journeys. They gain hands-on experience by organizing school-wide projects and participating in feedback sessions, ensuring their growth and development as capable and values-driven leaders.

The training emphasises the development of self-awareness, positivity, a growth mindset, and role-modelling. Students learn to understand their strengths and areas for improvement, maintain a positive attitude, embrace challenges as opportunities for growth, and set a good example for their peers. Additionally, the L-i-T programme fosters friendships with their seniors and peers, helping students feel supported by a community of leaders.

Opportunities are also provided to promote student co-agency in creating solutions, empowering them to take an active role in addressing challenges and building their confidence as leaders. This collaborative approach ensures that students are not only guided but also actively involved in the leadership process.

As students progress through the leadership training, they have the opportunity to take up formal leadership positions based on their readiness. This approach ensures that leadership roles are assumed by those who are prepared and demonstrate a commitment to our Canossian core values, further enhancing their ability to make meaningful contributions to our school and the community at large.
