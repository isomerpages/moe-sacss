<p>The Chinese Cultural Society aims to promote a strong sense of awareness
and appreciation of Chinese culture and heritage to students at SACSS.
We do this through regular sessions and special activities at various school
functions. Our members learn Chinese calligraphy, Chinese painting, paper
cutting and Chinese knots as well as other crafts. Students’ work pieces
are showcased in various parts of the school. During special festivals
such as the Lunar New year celebration, we also put up performances in
school and some of our craft work are regularly used as gifts for Teachers’
Day. Recently, our students were engaged in creating a mural using the
lotus to symbolise purity and innocence. The Chinese Cultural Society uses
various platforms to engage non-Chinese students in our activities especially
during fund raising events and through our immersion programmes with our
collaborative schools. Our members attend Chinese Painting Competitions
and Chinese Calligraphy Competition annually. In 2019, we attained both
first and second position in 9th&nbsp;SCCCE Arts Awards and Festival.</p>
