# GIRL GUIDES
SACSS Girl Guides is an active CCA group that provides opportunities for members to achieve their potential and empower them to enact social change. We engage in activities ranging from personal and social development, domestic and outdoor skills, advocacy, and learning more about the international guiding family. The guides are also taught contemporary lifeskills such as cyber-wellness, through the Surf Smart Badge, and positive body image and self-esteem mindsets, through the Free Being Me programme. We endeavour to help the community through projects such as fundraising for organisations such as Guide Dogs Singapore. We cultivate the guides’ love for the outdoors and teach them stewardship values towards our planet through our Annual Outdoor Camp held in November at Camp Christine. Some of our guides have also been participants of international overseas camps and developing penpal with Japanese sister schools, which provided the chance for cross-cultural collaboration with other members of the guiding movement. Evidenced by a Guide’s uniform, Guides work towards a range of unique badges to prove her skill in various areas. Those who display a strong guiding spirit may also be nominated for the Baden-Powell Award and President’s Guide Award – both awards of great prestige.
