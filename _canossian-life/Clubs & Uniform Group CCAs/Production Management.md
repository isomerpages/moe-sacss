The SACSS Production Management (PM) CCA equips and develops members’ skills in stage management. These skills include the technical aspects of lighting, sound and set as well as non-technical aspects such as backstage crewing.

The PM Team provides technical and management support for daily morning assembly and major school events. Some of these events include Masses, Chinese New Year Concert, Teachers’ Day Concert, Arts Alive, Awards Day and Graduation Day. Members are given the opportunity to collaborate with various CCAs in putting up successful performances. As members of the PM team, we take great pride in ensuring the success of all events and performances.
