The SACSS Media and Production Society (MPS) was formed in 2022, when the Digital Media Club (DMC) and Production Management (PM) CCAs were merged to optimise students’ CCA achievements and the teaching of emerging skillsets. MPS students are introduced to three separate areas of media production: photography, videography, and production management over the course of their 4-5 years in school. After the basic proficiencies are taught in Secondary 1, MPS students begin to take part in school events, morning assemblies and Zoom broadcasts, allowing them to put theory into practice. At the end of their Secondary 2 year, they may opt to specialise in one of the 3 areas for their Secondary 3 year. These specialists act as leaders in their field, mentoring and nurturing their juniors during CCA training sessions, event and morning assembly duties.

With the usual complex roster of school events, MPS plays an important part in ensuring key school events are run well. From the routine morning assemblies and morning Zoom broadcasts to complex school events like the St. Anthony’s Feast Day Mass and full-scale concerts like the Racial Harmony Day and Teachers’ Day concerts, MPS is instrumental in making school events possible.

In 2022, MPS supported the Arts Alive! Flash Mob event, which involved performances in various parts of the school. Aside from school duties, MPS members took part in competitions like the ‘Our School, Our Stories’ photography competition, and the Lions Home Video Competition 2022, where the team of 8 students clinched the second runner-up position out of 28 other entries. Indeed, MPS members develop adaptability and resilience, even as they perform their duties in the midst of their academic responsibilities. They forge stronger relationships with one other through this, ultimately contributing to a more united and cohesive group.
