The SACSS Media Resource Library (MRL) society is a vibrant CCA that plays an important part in building and encouraging a culture of reading in the school. The library also works closely with Academic Departments in the school to teach students research skills and how to locate and access resources in an appropriate manner. There are a number of on-going activities conducted on a regular basis which align to school and national initiatives and events. For example, in conjunction with the schoolâ€™s reading programme, several books and reading materials are promoted regularly through the library Instagram account. Other interesting school wide events planned include the photo essay competition in conjunction with National Reading Month in July and the Kids Lit Quiz and Racial Harmony Quiz.
