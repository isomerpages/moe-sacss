**Our Values-In-Action (VIA) Programme**

Our Values-In-Action (VIA) programme aligns with the school’s vision by providing authentic, hands-on opportunities for students to develop their leadership and service skills.

**Foundress VIA Framework**

The Foundress VIA Framework, aligned with the school’s strategic thrusts – Belong, Believe, and Become, allows for a tiered progression across the levels, culminating in our students becoming Canossians of Influence.

•     Secondary 1: In collaboration with the English Language Department, students write letters of encouragement to our affiliated Primary 6 juniors, sharing their own PSLE journey and transition experience into secondary school. This activity helps them to reach out to their juniors and share their sense of belonging to the school.

•     Secondary 2: Guided by their teachers, students select a beneficiary to work with under our Talent Take Off programme. From 2024, our students will be led through the design thinking process and are taught the necessary skills to perform three functions – Advocacy, Activity, and Active Volunteering.

•     Secondary 3: Students apply the skills of  Advocacy, Activity, and Active Volunteering to organize the annual school carnival, SAC Blaze, where funds are raised for students’ choice beneficiaries. They tap into their Social Studies knowledge to research social welfare issues in Singapore, choose a beneficiary, advocate for them, and run a game stall fully conceptualized and organized by them.

• Secondary 4: In collaboration with our Canossian Sisters, fine examples of Canossians of Influence, the Foundress VIA Framework culminates with students celebrating their development. Each graduating class hosts a few sisters for an interactive tea session, engaging in candid conversations before expressing their gratitude with a personalized gift.

  
**Additional Projects**

Beyond these projects, departments and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) such as the Mother Tongue Department, the CCA Executive Committees, and the Girl Guides also spearhead individual VIA projects. The school encourages student-initiated VIA projects and shares VIA opportunities with the girls via online platforms. To further recognize and encourage students’ efforts in active volunteerism, the school awards the Thio Ying Ying Bursary Award annually at our school’s awards ceremony.
