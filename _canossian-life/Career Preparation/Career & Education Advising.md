#### **Career Education and Advising**



The premise of SACSS Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Framework builds on the idea that every student possesses unique talents waiting to be discovered and developed. Our program recognizes that work can be more than just a paycheck—it can be a source of personal meaning and a way to contribute to society. We align our approach with the Ministry of Education's (MOE) ECG framework, which aims to:

*   Discover purpose: Help students identify their passions, strengths, and values to make informed decisions about their future.
    
*   Explore opportunities: Expose students to a wide range of educational and career pathways, including both traditional and emerging fields.
    
*   Stay relevant: Equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to adapt to a constantly evolving job market and pursue lifelong learning.
    

At lower secondary, we focus on self-awareness and exploration. This is done through the Talent Take-Off Programme (see previous tab).

As the students progress to upper secondary, we focus on providing varied opportunities and experiences to guide students to make informed decisions in planning for post-secondary academic and career pathways:

*   Applied Learning Modules (ApLM@ITE and ApLM@Poly)
    
*   Career Experience during school holidays
    
*   Career fairs at other institutions
    
*   Entrepreneurship workshop for St Magdelene’s Club students
    
*   Experience ITE Programme&nbsp;
    
*   Polytechnic and NAFA taster workshops
    
*   Polytechnic open houses during S4/5 orientation week
    
*   Sharing by alumni, institutions and industry partners
    

The school provides support for graduating students by ensuring that they are confident and capable in preparing their EAE and DSA applications. Some of the programs organised to hone their skills include:&nbsp;

*   Grooming and etiquette workshop&nbsp;
    
*   Interview skills workshop
    
*   Personal statement writing workshop
    
*   Structural referral programme
    
*   Mock interviews to prepare for upcoming interviews
