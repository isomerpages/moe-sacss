# FLOORBALL
The SACSS Floorball team comprises a group of disciplined, fun-loving and committed members who are constantly growing, as individuals in character and skills, as well as in a team. Through rigorous training sessions and team-bonding activities, we forge friendships whilst developing our tactical skills. Through the CCA activities, we strive to utilize every learning moment to help every player better understand their roles in the team, through bringing about a sense of responsibility. At the same time, we aim to provide a safe and conducive environment for the players to learn, grow and have fun. We believe that every member can be an engaged contributor to the team. Hence, every member is an active participant of their respective sub-committee, be it in Publicity and Logistics committee, the VIA committee, Physical Training committee or the Welfare committee, where they work together to improve the operations and welfare of the entire team.
