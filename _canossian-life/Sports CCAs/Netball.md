# NETBALL
Netball is a team based sport that emphasises on physical abilities and technical skills. The SACSS netball team takes pride in developing our members’ physical and mental strength through weekly training sessions and team bonding activities. The players form long-lasting bonds and friendships with one another, motivating each other to constantly do their utmost best on court.  We aim to develop good sportsmanship in our team members and nurture the students’ ability to play competitively at national competitions. Additionally, members develop other skills such as planning and umpiring when they organise friendly competitions for other schools and for our sister primary school, SACPS.  Through these activities, they develop leadership skills and compassion for others and they also forge strong bonds and friendships with one other.
