The Drama Elective programme was started in Jan 2006. SACSS is proud to be one of the pioneer that offers drama in the curriculum and drama as an Elective GCE O-Level Exam subject. There are currently only 7 other schools offering this programme. Through the years, SACSS has consistently performed very well in the O Level Drama Elective programme and produced outstanding results.

While the demands of the Drama Elective programme are high, the benefits far outweigh the demands. The 3 domains of producing, presenting and reflecting which provide the framework for those with the aptitude for offering GCE O Level Drama will place students in good stead for a future which requires them to improvise, think on their feet and negotiate â€“ all the necessary skills required in the 21st century.
