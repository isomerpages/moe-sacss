**Key Programmes to be carried out in FY2021:**

**Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)**

**1) CCE Key Events**

The Foundress Day Values-in-Action (Bags of Blessing) project will feature all students (4-5 students in each group) putting together 250 care boxes for the elderly from Sunlove Chai Chee. Instead of visiting the elderly, the teachers did a presentation of our past years collaboration with Sunlove Chai Chee and did an interview with the Centre Manager. 

**2) SACS Blaze – A Worthy Cause!**

The Secondary 3 students’ Values-in-Action (VIA) project will be carried out virtually. Each class identifies a specific beneficiary and will do a presentation to the whole school population. In each presentation, the students will share what each beneficiary stood for and the group of individuals that they care for. Following the presentation, the school population will be called upon to donate items to the organisation.

There is no fundraising activities carried out in the year.  
 

**Key Programmes carried out in FY2020:**

**1) CCE Key Events**

The Foundress Day Values-in-Action (Rallying Together) project featured groups of students (4-5 students in each group) from each class putting together 250 care boxes for the elderly from Sunlove Chai Chee. Due to COVID-19, we did not visit and interview the elderly from our neighbouring one-room rentals flats this year.

**2) SAC Blaze – A Worthy Cause!**

The plan was to have a **La Scintilla**, a week’s activities comprising of Curriculum Week, Night Festival and SAC Blaze. Due to the Full Home-Based Learning and Safe Management Measures (SMM), the Secondary 3 students’ Values-in-Action (VIA) projects were scaled down. Instead of having face-to-face carnival, the students moved their VIA efforts online. Each class identified a specific beneficiary and did a presentation to the whole school population. In each presentation, the students shared what each beneficiary stood for and the group of individuals that they cared for. Following the presentation, the school population was called upon to donate items for the organisation. 

There was no fundraising activities carried out in the year.
