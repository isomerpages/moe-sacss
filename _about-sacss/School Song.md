The aspirations of the Canossian Sisters for girls are best captured in the school song acting as a constant reminder of the schools' educational aims. The lyrics were penned in 1967 by Sister Carmen Dengah who was both teacher & principal from 1969-1976. Mrs Christine Kanagarajah, who taught for over 40 years from 1958 to 2000, composed the music.

 
##### **Verse 1**

United in common endeavour  
At work and play, life’s lessons we learn  
Our youthful hearts are filled with ardour  
For truth and wisdom we yearn

##### **Chorus**

Courageously with heads held high  
We march ever on through life  
Schooled in your spirit canossa  
For virtue, true nobility we strive  
Schooled in your spirit canossa  
For true virtue we strive

##### **Verse 2**

Our alma mater, our guardian, our guide  
Prepare our spirits for duty’s call  
Our country to serve with virtuous might  
We stand for truth and for right
