<p><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1) CCE Key Events</strong>
</p>
<p>The Foundress Day Values-in-Action (Bags of Blessing) project will feature
all students (4-5 students in each group) putting together 250 care boxes
for the elderly from Sunlove Chai Chee. Instead of visiting the elderly,
the teachers did a presentation of our past years collaboration with Sunlove
Chai Chee and did an interview with the Centre Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) SACS Blaze – A Worthy Cause!</strong>
</p>
<p>The Secondary 3 students’ Values-in-Action (VIA) project will&nbsp;be
carried out virtually. Each class identifies a specific&nbsp;beneficiary
and will do a presentation to the whole school population. In each presentation,
the students will share what each beneficiary stood for and the group of
individuals that they care for. Following the presentation, the school
population will be called upon to donate items to the organisation.</p>
<p>There is no fundraising activities carried out in the year.</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes carried out in FY2020:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1) CCE Key Events</strong>
</p>
<p>The Foundress Day Values-in-Action (Rallying Together) project featured
groups of students (4-5 students in each group) from each class putting
together 250 care boxes for the elderly from Sunlove Chai Chee. Due to
COVID-19, we did not visit and interview the elderly from our neighbouring
one-room rentals flats this year.</p>
<p><strong>2) SAC Blaze – A Worthy Cause!</strong>
</p>
<p>The plan was to have a&nbsp;<strong>La Scintilla</strong>, a week’s activities
comprising of Curriculum Week, Night Festival and SAC Blaze. Due to the
Full Home-Based Learning and Safe Management Measures (SMM), the Secondary
3 students’ Values-in-Action (VIA) projects were scaled down. Instead of
having face-to-face carnival, the students moved their VIA efforts online.
Each class identified a specific beneficiary and did a presentation to
the whole school population. In each presentation, the students shared
what each beneficiary stood for and the group of individuals that they
cared for. Following the presentation, the school population was called
upon to donate items for the organisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no fundraising activities carried out in the year.</p>
