<p><strong><u>St. Magdalene of Canossa</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This wall mural was painted in 2024 to celebrate the 250th Anniversary
of the birth of Our Foundress. Replicating the façade of the Canossa Palace,
home to our Foundress, St. Magdalene of Canossa in Verona, the colourful
mural that stands at the entrance of the school illuminates our Canossian
charism. The scene depicts the charitable spirit of St. Magdalene as exemplified
in the interaction between the young and old, and people of different races
at the “bread door” to symbolize the global outreach of the Canossian missions.
The “bread door” as it is affectionately known was where Our Foundress
distributed bread to the poor and hungry. The Sisters continued this tradition
at 111 Middle Road, distributing daily necessities to the needy. As illustrated
in the mural, we, like the children, are called to be a “bread door” to
those around us, feeding those who hunger and thirst with God’s healing
love. The benches reflect the interactive nature of the mural, welcoming
us to sit with the characters. As we sit next to them, we are invited to
contemplate on our humanity. In doing so, we radiate our humility by embracing
the young and old around us, lifting them up by our charitable words and
deeds, and empowering them to recognise their dignity as children of God.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The symbolism of the wall mural echoes the words of St Pope John Paul
II when he canonised Magdalene of Canossa on 2 October 1988, as a one who
embodies “Chairty in Humility; Humility in Charity”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Saint Magdalene of Canossa's life story is a testament to her unwavering
faith and profound compassion for the marginalized and impoverished. Born
into privilege in Verona, Italy, she experienced profound loss of her parents
and abandonment at a young age, finding solace in her deep devotion to
Jesus and Mother Mary. Despite the societal contrasts and upheavals of
her time, Magdalene dedicated her life to serving those in need, particularly
children, youth, and women affected by poverty and war. Leaving behind
her family's wealth, she founded the Daughters of Charity and established
herself in the poverty-stricken district of San Zeno, embodying a radical
commitment to love and service. Today, her legacy lives on through the
global presence of the Daughters of Charity and the Canossian family, continuing
her mission of revealing God's love to humanity. Canonized by Pope John
Paul II in 1988, Saint Magdalene of Canossa remains a beacon of charity
and hope, inspiring countless souls to follow in her footsteps of love
and service in a broken world.</p>

<p><strong><u>St. Josephine Margaret Bakhita</u></strong>
</p>
<p>“If I were to meet those slave raiders that abducted me and those who
tortured me, I'd kneel down to them to kiss their hands, because, if it
had not have been for them, I would not have become a Christian and a religious."</p>
<p></p>
<p>This wall mural was painted in 2023 in preparation for the school’s 145th
anniversary celebration in 2024. Greeted by the image of St. Josephine
Margaret Bakhita as one walks towards the Hall, the word “Forgive” radiates
in all directions. Like St. Bakhita, we are called to forgive. Forgiveness
is a profound expression of love, compassion, and humanity. It enables
us to move forward with grace, empathy, and a renewed sense of hope, enriching
both our lives and the lives of those around us. When we walk out of the
Hall, “Faith” is projected in all angles. We are called to walk in faith,
and not merely by sight. St. Bakhita reminds us that with faith, we can
be freed from our modern enslavement, and grow into the person we are called
to become. Faith provides a foundation for living a meaningful, purposeful,
and fulfilling life. It enriches our experiences, strengthens our relationships,
and sustains us through life's joys and challenges. The anamorphic art
symbolises the importance of being centred. When we forgive and walk in
faith, we experience peace and grow in hope and optimism to become Canossians
of Influence.</p>

<p>Saint Josephine Margaret Bakhita's life journey epitomizes the triumph
of the human spirit over adversity. Kidnapped as a child by Arab slave
traders, she endured unimaginable hardships, being bought and sold numerous
times and subjected to brutal treatment. Despite enduring 12 years of captivity
and experiencing deep physical and emotional scars, she found solace and
hope through her encounter with the Canossian Sisters in Venice, where
she discovered God's love and her own innate dignity. Refusing to return
to slavery, she successfully fought for her freedom in court, embracing
a new life of faith and service. Baptized and named Josephine Margaret
and Fortunata, she dedicated herself to the service of God as a Canossian
Sister, embodying forgiveness, love, and perseverance. Her remarkable journey
from slavery to sanctity continues to inspire countless souls, reminding
us of the transformative power of faith and the resilience of the human
spirit in the face of adversity.</p>
