# WELL-BEING
### <center>Your wellness matters.</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With an established student development team for every level, our approach towards well-being is integrated, focusing on the holistic importance of the social, emotional, mental, physical, spiritual and academic wellbeing of our girls. We understand that when you feel well and in control of the many aspects of your lives, you confront obstacles and challenges with confidence and a belief in your capacity to solve problems. It is our objective to empower you to understand what underpins good health, such that you set and pursue goals to ensure your wellbeing is a priority. Through our multi-faceted student support programmes, we ensure the social, financial, personal and environmental factors in each of your lives work together to maximise your learning and develop you as an independent, self-aware and resilient young woman.</p>

Phyllis graduated from SACSS in 2016 and went on to pursue a Diploma in Business at Temasek Polytechnic. At SACSS, she was a Student Leader and part of the Executive Committee. The leadership roles she was groomed for at SACSS prepared her for some of her proudest moments. She was on the Temasek Polytechnic Directors’ list for 3 consecutive years from 2017 to 2020. Phyllisalso achieved 3 well-deserved awards in 2020, namely, the Lee Hsien Loong Award for All Round Excellence, the CapitaLand All Rounder Award and Student Leader of the Year. She attributes her success to her time at SACSS and the lessons on servant leadership and the ability to confront obstacles and challenges with confidence. Through their role-modelling, teachers at SACSS taught her to find herself, be independent and self-aware. “I came from a humble family and we did not have much. But SACSS taught me about strong character development and resilience and I learnt that education and good character shapes you.”
