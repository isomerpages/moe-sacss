# BREADTH

### Your interests matter.

Breadth is a key feature of our Canossian education which allows you to build on your interest through a wide range of modules and CCAs that promote your creativity streak and build your portfolio beyond the confines of the classroom. Through our **_Performing Arts, Young Scholars Programme, Talent Take-off_** **_and Applied Learning Programmes_**, you will develop a broader range of skills that may not traditionally be available within the MOE curriculum. Designed and taught in partnership with alumni, vendors and educational institutions, these modules address topics through diverse disciplinary lenses. You will learn how to synthesise ideas from different fields and collaborate in multidisciplinary settings which are highly valued and needed in solving many of the world’s challenges.
