# 4C THE FUTURE
### <center> <b>4C the Future: Competence, Compassion, Commitment & Cheerfulness</b></center>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Here at SACSS, we want our girls to have more than a successful career. With the rapid changes, increased psychosocial stressors and high adaptive demands required of individuals, we want our girls to be persons who are holistically integrated - fully alive; with formed hearts, enlightened minds and empowered spirits. Here, their interests, talents, goals and spirituality are knitted together into a cohesive thread to reflect joy in life and faith. </p>

### <center> <b>We believe</b></center>

<center> …in the potential of our girls and their power to make a positive impact on the lives of those around them. We appreciate commonalities, yet we celebrate differences. We inspire, inform and enable our girls to make the most of their talents and opportunities. We help our girls understand the world we live in, and give them the dispositions and skillset to grow throughout their lives in order to create a better future for themselves and others. </center>

<center>Our girls are:</center>

*   <p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Competent</i> to be solutions-oriented and community focused, resourceful and collaborative to adapt to any unexpected scenarios and lead through challenges.</p>
*    <p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Compassionate</i> to be sensitive to the suffering of others and inspire courageous deeds and solutions that serve and help those in need.</p>
*   <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Committed</i> to staying true to themselves, their values, convictions and goals, continuing on the path even in the face of adversity.</p>
*   <p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Cheerful</i> to be comfortable with themselves and possess the resilience to bring happiness and positivity to self and others.</p>
