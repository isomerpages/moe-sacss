### <center>Your significance matters.</center>

Beyond getting good grades, it is important to develop a purpose in life beyond a mundane everyday existence. At SACSS, we develop your personhood. Here, we take time to reflect on the meaning of events in life and we develop your ability to explain why you believe, in order to guide your sense of right and wrong and act accordingly. Through our Canossian Formation Journey, we create opportunities for you to learn more about charity, humility, forgiveness and faith; to heal from past hurts and affirm your self-worth for love, compassion and generosity in life. Once you understand why youâ€™re driven to feel significant to those around you, you can better interpret your own actions and use this desire to help you work toward fulfilling your goals and supporting those around you.
