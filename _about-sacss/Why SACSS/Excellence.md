#### **Tricia Chin**

Tricia is an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore pursuing a degree in Life Sciences with a minor in Public Health. At SACSS, Tricia was the Vice-Head girl and later became the President of the Student Council at Victoria Junior College. In 2018, she achieved the VJC award for Excellence in service and academics. In 2019, received 3 other awards, namely, the Goh Chok Tong Nextgen Outstanding Student Leader Award, the Dr Ong Chit Chung’s Trophy for Outstanding Service to the College and the CCA Service Award. Tricia believes that service is the key to seeking satisfaction and motivation in what you do and she attributes many of her excellent achievements to the opportunities provided at SACSS. She says, “SACSS was a conducive environment for us to explore our sense of identity and who we were and to always strive for our personal best. Despite being academically driven, the growth of character was emphasised, and it felt like everyone was their unique person, something I feel is lacking in other places sometimes.” Tricia continues to volunteer at several organisations and is currently an intern with Schneider Electric.
