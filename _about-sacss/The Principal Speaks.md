**2023: In Faith, We Serve**

**“Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Never rely on what you think you know. Remember the Lord in everything you do, He will show you the right way.” Proverbs 3: 5-6**

**“Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Never rely on what you think you know. Remember the Lord in everything you do, He will show you the right way.” Proverbs 3: 5-6**

In 2022, we gradually returned to normalcy as we exited the shroud of COVID-19. We remain steadfast in our mission to nurture our girls - forming their hearts, enlightening their minds and empowering their spirits, by providing them with enlivening holistic school experiences.  We give thanks for the various achievements and contributions of our students and staff in the academic subjects, aesthetics and sporting fields. Notable achievements included our school’s first recipient of the President Award for Teachers and the Netball team’s 4th place finish at the ‘B’ Division games. More highlights have been captured on our school’s Facebook and Instagram sites to celebrate and connect all of us as a community.

Our 2023 school theme _In Faith, We Serve_ reminds our staff and students to keep faith and grow in our service. In a world filled with complexities due to technological changes, competing economic imperatives and different psychosocial stressors, we will continue to strive to be Canossians of Influence who are ready to lead with **compassion** and **competence**; serve with **cheerfulness** and **commitment.**

*   _Compassionate_ to be sensitive to the sufferings of others and inspire courageous deeds and solutions to serve and help those in need.
*   _Competent_ to be solutions-oriented and community-focused, resourceful and collaborative to adapt to any unexpected scenarios and overcome challenges.
*   _Committed_ to staying true to themselves, their values, convictions and goals; persevering in the face of adversity.
*   _Cheerful_ to be comfortable with themselves and to bring happiness and positivity to self and others.

As we move into our next phase of growth, we will be strengthening our approaches to help our students deepen their joy for learning.  Focusing on positive education (PERMAH\* model of well-being), as well as building a positive school culture that encourages strong relationships amongst students, teachers and parents, the school will continue to augment the nurturing, innovative and dynamic environment. Beyond academic achievements, we want our girls to be anchored in our school values while navigating the fast-changing world we live in. Our total curriculum aims to prepare our girls for the future by equipping them with dispositions and skillsets essential for them to thrive in the 21st Century.

To our prospective students and interested parents, joining us at SACSS will be the beginning of an exciting and fulfilling journey where your daughter can expect to be challenged and supported in equal measure. Be a part of a community that celebrates, nurtures, and respects individuality; a community where girls are free to explore, try new things, and overcome fear of failure. We look forward to welcoming you to St Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School.

_\*The PERMAH model of wellbeing outlines five key pillars for flourishing and thriving at work and beyond: Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment and Health._
