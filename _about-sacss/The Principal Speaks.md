# **2025: Pilgrims of Hope**

**“Hope does not disappoint, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.” Rom 5:1-2.5**

Established in 1879, the school started as St. Anna’s School in a rented shop-house at Middle Road by Fr. Jose Pedro Santa Anna de Cunha of St. Joseph’s Church for the poor parishioners in 1879. With the arrival of the Canossian Sisters in 1894, the school moved to 111 Middle Road and became known as St. Anthony’s Convent School. It was eventually renamed to St. Anthony’s Canossian Primary and Secondary School in 1995 when it moved to the current Bedok campus. The inclusion of “Canossian” in the name of the school was done in celebration of our unique Canossian brand of education, forming hearts and offering a personalised approach to holistic education.

Over the years, we have evolved and adapted to the changing educational landscape, consistently striving for innovation while upholding our core values of Faith, Charity, Humility and Forgiveness. We continue to build a nurturing and dynamic environment where students are encouraged to explore their interests, develop critical thinking skills, and discover their full potential. We are strengthening our approaches to deepen students’ joy for learning through positive education and the development of 21st century competencies.  This way, our total curriculum prepares our young women for the future by equipping them with dispositions and skillsets essential for them to thrive in the 21st Century.

As our school celebrates 146 years of nurturing and educating young women, we are proud to join Canossian schools worldwide in embracing Pope Francis’s call to commemorate the Jubilee Year of Hope. Guided by this year’s theme, "Pilgrims of Hope," we aim to inspire our students to walk a path rooted in faith, charity, humility, and purpose. In a world filled with challenges, we believe hope is a transformative force that empowers young women to live with resilience and compassion.

Our journey as Pilgrims of Hope is framed by five actionable steps that shape our mission and spirit:

1.      **Seek Good**: We encourage our students to actively pursue opportunities for growth, learning, and meaningful contribution, becoming confident learners and compassionate leaders.

2.      **See Good in Others**: By fostering empathy, we teach our young women to recognise the unique strengths and inherent goodness in everyone, even amidst diversity and imperfections.

3.      **Wish for Good**: Our community cultivates hearts that celebrate the well-being and success of others, fostering joy and unity.

4.      **Do Good**: Through acts of charity, integrity, and forgiveness, our students transform hope into meaningful action, leaving a positive impact wherever they go.

5.      **Inspire Good**: By leading through example, our students inspire others to reach their full potential and spread hope in their families, friendships, and communities.

These principles are not just ideals but a living mission that shapes the character of every student. As we journey through this year of hope, we encourage parents to join us in creating an environment where your daughters can thrive, grow, and become empowered individuals who shine as beacons of hope in the world.

To our prospective students and interested parents, we invite you to explore our website, learn more about our programmes and the unique opportunities that await you. Joining us at St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School will be the beginning of an exciting and fulfilling journey where girls can expect to be challenged and supported in equal measure. Be a part of a community that celebrates, nurtures, and respects individuality; a community where girls are free to explore, learn new things, and overcome fear of failure. We look forward to welcoming you to St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School.
