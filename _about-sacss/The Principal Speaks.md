# **2026: Shine Peace to Our World**

**“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.” (Matthew 5:9)**

As we begin the year together, our school is guided by the 2026 theme: Shine Peace to Our World. Inspired by the Holy Father’s New Year message calling us to “build a year of peace, disarming our hearts and refraining from all violence,” this theme speaks deeply to the realities our girls face today—amidst noise, pressure, comparison, and conflict.

This call to peace is deeply rooted in our school’s story. Established in 1879, St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School began humbly as St. Anna’s School, founded by Fr. Jose Pedro Santa Anna de Cunha of St. Joseph’s Church to serve poor parishioners in a rented shophouse along Middle Road. With the arrival of the Canossian Sisters in 1894, the school took on a renewed mission and identity, becoming St. Anthony’s Convent School—a place where education was understood not merely as academic instruction, but as the formation of the heart.

When the school moved to our current Bedok campus in 1995 and was renamed St. Anthony’s Canossian Primary and Secondary School, the inclusion of the word “Canossian” marked a conscious celebration of our distinctive Canossian brand of education—one that is deeply personal, values-led, and committed to holistic formation. This heritage continues to shape who we are today.

At St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School, peace is not passive. It is lived out daily through thoughtful choices, responsible actions, and care for others. Our students are guided to grow as socially responsible individuals who can contribute positively to their communities and the wider world, learning to live out peace in three meaningful and connected ways.

1.  **Peace Starts Within**

I choose what is good for me.

We help our girls build strong inner foundations through self-awareness, emotional regulation, and self-mastery. With a strong emphasis on building 21 century competencies, we train our students in **metacognition** \- students learn how to plan, monitor, and reflect on their learning, becoming **confident and self-directed learners**. Thoughtful use of **digital technology** supports organisation, feedback, and independent growth, while clear guidance helps students make wise, healthy choices, reject harmful behaviours, and develop **resilience** rooted in self-worth and dignity.

2.  **Peace Among Us**

I disarm my words, actions, and friendships.

Our school culture places strong emphasis on relationships built on **respect**, **empathy**, and **responsibility**. Through intentional structures that promote student self-advocacy and help-seeking, alongside proactive efforts to support well-being and prevent bullying, girls learn to communicate responsibly—both online and offline—resolve conflicts constructively, and take responsibility for their actions. These experiences nurture joy, serenity, and forgiveness, even when circumstances are challenging.

3.  **Shine Peace to the World**

I bring calm, respect, and responsibility into every space I enter.

Beyond the school gates, our girls are encouraged to become active contributors with a strong moral compass. Through meaningful community partnerships, including collaborations with **Catholic Welfare Services**, students encounter real people and real needs, learning to act with compassion, integrity, and civic-mindedness. Signature platforms such as the **Arts Alive Showcase**, **EPIC Day** (Exploring Pathways, Interests and Careers), and **overseas learning journeys** to Japan, China, Indonesia, and Taiwan broaden perspectives, build confidence, and inspire our girls to serve and lead with purpose in an interconnected world.

Through this theme, our girls are gently formed to recognise their God-given dignity, cultivate inner peace and self-mastery, practise solidarity and compassion in relationships, and live out peace in the ordinary moments of daily life—growing into concerned citizens who act for the common good with responsibility, conscience, and love.

All our programmes and initiatives are thoughtfully designed with our students at the heart, creating safe spaces and authentic opportunities for them to try, grow, care, and reflect on who they are becoming. At SACSS, we believe every girl carries within her a unique light, and we are committed to helping her shine it with peace, courage, competence, and compassion. Together, these outcomes shape confident, thoughtful, responsible, and caring young women—Canossians of Influence, ready to lead with compassion and competence, and to serve with cheerfulness and commitment.

To our prospective students and parents, we warmly invite you to explore our website and discover the programmes, culture, and distinctive opportunities that await you. Joining St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School marks the beginning of a meaningful and fulfilling journey—one where a rich heritage meets forward-looking education, and where every girl is known, valued, and formed to flourish with purpose and hope.
