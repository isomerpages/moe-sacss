## **2024: In Fiamme (Set Life on Fire)**

**“If you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.” Isaiah 58:10**

Established in 1879, the school started as St. Anna’s School in a rented shop-house at Middle Road by Fr. Jose Pedro Santa Anna de Cunha of St. Joseph’s Church for the poor parishioners in 1879. With the arrival of the Canossian Sisters in 1894, the school moved to 111 Middle Road and became known as St. Anthony’s Convent School. It was eventually renamed to St. Anthony’s Canossian Primary and Secondary School in 1995 when it moved to the current Bedok campus. The inclusion of “Canossian” in the name of the school was done in celebration of our unique Canossian brand of education, forming hearts and offering a personalised approach to holistic education.

Over the years, we have evolved and adapted to the changing educational landscape, consistently striving for innovation while upholding our core values of Faith, Charity, Humility and Forgiveness. We continue to build a nurturing and dynamic environment where students are encouraged to explore their interests, develop critical thinking skills, and discover their full potential. We are strengthening our approaches to deepen students’ joy for learning through positive education and the development of 21st century competencies.  This way, our total curriculum prepares our girls for the future by equipping them with dispositions and skillsets essential for them to thrive in the 21st Century.

2024 marks a significant milestone for the school as we celebrate our 145th anniversary as well as join our global family of Canossians in commemorating the 250th anniversary of the birth of our Foundress, St. Magdelene of Canossa. It is a testament to the enduring legacy of our Canossian institution and the countless success stories of our alumni. The theme, “In Fiamme” (Set Life on Fire), speaks of the missionary zest that lit our Foundress’ life with the fire of charity. We remember and give thanks for the spirit and charism of the Foundress through the ‘ABCD’:

* Above all, make Jesus known and loved: As a school, we are called to radiate light and hope to our community and Singapore, looking out for those who are forgotten, forsaken and feeble.
* Breathe Charity in Relationships: To love and forgive one another despite differences and limitations to embrace diversity, treating each one with respect and kindness.
* Cultivate Humility: To grow in self-confidence, accepting our personal strengths and weaknesses, while seeking continuous improvement to learn beyond textbooks and beyond grades. The goals are to develop life-long learning dispositions and 21st century competencies.
* Discern Desires: To discern the use and growth of our gifts and talents so that we are drawn to lead and serve for the common good, rather than be driven by fear, insecurity, and pride.

Do join us and the Canossian Sisters in commemorating this historic occasion through celebratory masses, the Night Festival, community outreach programmes and an alumni home-coming lunch. There will be something for everyone to participate in and enjoy.
To our prospective students and interested parents, we invite you to explore our website, learn more about our programmes and the unique opportunities that await you. Joining us at St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School will be the beginning of an exciting and fulfilling journey where girls can expect to be challenged and supported in equal measure. Be a part of a community that celebrates, nurtures, and respects individuality; a community where girls are free to explore, learn new things, and overcome the fear of failure. We look forward to welcoming you to St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School.
