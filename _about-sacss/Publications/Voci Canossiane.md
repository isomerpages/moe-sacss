**Voices of a New Generation** 
  
In line with our review of our Vision and Mission statements and in our quest to deepen our Canossian roots and capture the voices of the new generation of Canossians at SACSS, our previous newsletter, CORRI Connections has been retitled and redesigned as Voci Canossiane, a digital newsletter. Our aim is to inspire readers with new ways of thinking; promote greater awareness of events affecting staff and students; and capture issues that empower and resonate with our girls.  
  
We would like to acknowledge and thank Sr Cecily Pavri, who was Principal of SACSS for 16 years and is also an alumna of the school, for providing a  
befitting title to this newsletter in Italian that signifies the Canossian Voices of our students, staff and stakeholders.
