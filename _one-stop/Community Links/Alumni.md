The Canossian Alumni Association (CAA) preserves the heart and soul of the friendships and relationships that have been built in our Canossian schools. We create opportunities for the alumni to come together, reconnect with old friends and create new social ties. We do this through various activities such as high teas, learning journeys, craft workshops, and themed virtual gatherings. 

CAA enables every alumni to live an empowering life the Canossian way, by embracing our Canossian values, bonding with fellow alumni, developing our own unique potential and contributing to make a difference to alma mater, community and society.
