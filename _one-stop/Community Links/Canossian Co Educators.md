# CANOSSIAN CO-EDUCATORS

At SACSS, our parent volunteers are known as Canossian Co-Educators. We strongly believe in forming a tripartite relationship between the school, the parents and the girls. 

Through the years, we have been involved in several activities to support the school. We have run booths for the Night Festival and other Fund-Raising Projects and Carnivals, helped with the sale cookies and flowers for Mothers’ Day and even done breakfast meals for Teachers’ Day. We are most proud of our **Greenery@SACSS Project** which is an effort to promote a green model school and enhance the vibrancy of the school environment through nature.

GREENERY @ SACSS (Collaboration with Parent-Volunteers)

In an effort to promote greening and to become a green model school, special attention is given to the landscaping of our school. Planting of trees and flowers provides a sense of seasonal change that enhances beauty and vibrancy of the environment. However, bringing greenery into the school does more than just beautify. It allows for the expansion of teaching and learning beyond the confines of the classroom, creating ‘borderless classrooms’.

The Greenery @ SACSS is a whole school-approach to introduce greening into the school. Greening adds aesthetic quality to the urban design thereby promoting a more pleasant school milieu and to soften the harsh concrete surroundings.

This includes the setting up of the following places:

a. Evolutionary Ecological Trail  
b. Medicinal Herbal / Sensory Garden  
c. Ornamental (Edible Yard, Herbs and Spices, Food Crops) Garden  
d. English Garden  
e. Hydroponics Farm and Experimentation Room (Autopots Project)
