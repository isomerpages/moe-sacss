# CONCERT BAND
Established as a military band in the early 1970s, we developed into a concert band in 1993 and our member strength currently stands at 70. Our band motto,Â _Andare Avanti_, is Italian for pushing ahead and that is basically what the Concert B and strives to do - moving forward, achieving as many accomplishments as we can. Band members can look forward to learning a new instrument, exploring pieces from different genres and honing their skills of teamwork and leadership. Most importantly, despite the different abilities of each student, we come together to perform as one, by forging friendships and making memories. Besides the biennial Singapore Youth Festival, the SACSS Concert Band has performed at different venues across the island, and participated in band exchanges with both local and international bands, one of the most notable being the 7th Winter Band Festival, held in Hong Kong in November 2015, where we were awarded the Gold Award.
