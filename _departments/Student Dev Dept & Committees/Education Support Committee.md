The Education Support Committee collaborates with the school to empower all students with essential mindsets and executive functioning skills for effective learning and personal development, such as how to set realistic and achievable goals, take steps to work towards them, and overcome challenges along the way. This includes providing holistic and comprehensive support to students with unique learning needs by working together with subject teachers, specialised personnel, parents, and external stakeholders so that they can achieve their fullest potential. Alongside these initiatives, the team also looks into the holistic development of students with Special Education Needs (SEN). The team taps on the affordances of technology, puts in place programmes and works together with external agencies, staff and students to strengthen an inclusive school culture where every student can thrive and succeed.
