**SAC Student Leadership**

  

**Fostering Future Leaders through Authentic Experiences and Development Pathways**

At our school, the Student Leadership Committee provides students with valuable and authentic opportunities to lead and serve the community. Our program aligns with the guiding principles of the CCE 2021 Curriculum, which emphasizes student-centricity, intentionality, and coherence. By structuring our leadership programmes to offer differentiated development pathways, we ensure that all students receive essential leadership training, while some are given opportunities for more advanced development.

  

**Student-Centricity: Authentic Experiences and Teachable Moments**

Central to our approach is the principle of student-centricity, which focuses on providing both planned authentic experiences and teachable moments. Student leaders are given numerous opportunities to lead school wide initiatives that promote positive education and student wellness that are anchored in the PERMAH framework. Through their involvement in these initiatives, student leaders not only develop their leadership skills but also cultivate a sense of responsibility and belonging within the school community. They become stewards of positive change, driving initiatives that create a supportive, inclusive, and enriching environment for all.

  

**The Leadership Challenge Model**

Our leadership development is guided by The Leadership Challenge Model, a well-established framework that emphasizes five key practices:

  

1.  **Model the Way**: Leaders set an example by aligning their actions with shared values.
    
2.  **Inspire a Shared Vision**: Leaders envision the future and enlist others in that vision.
    
3.  **Challenge the Process**: Leaders seek innovative ways to change, grow, and improve.
    
4.  **Enable Others to Act**: Leaders foster collaboration and empower others.
    
5.  **Encourage the Heart**: Leaders recognize contributions and celebrate values and victories.
    

  

  

**Coherence in Leadership Development**

To ensure coherence in our program, we guide students through progressive stages of leadership development, starting with personal leadership, advancing to peer and team leadership, and ultimately preparing them to mentor junior leaders in the Leader-in-Training (L-i-T) program. Through schoolwide projects, leadership camps, and the conduct of leadership training, student leaders gain practical experience in leading others, developing teamwork and interpersonal skills, and understanding effective leadership.

  

**Integrated Reflection and Growth**

Throughout all stages of the programme, students engage in continuous reflection and growth mindset practices. Activities such as authentic conversations, peer feedback sessions, and regular meetings with mentors help students reflect on their experiences, understand their personal strengths and areas for improvement, and set informed goals for their future development. By maintaining coherence and integrating reflection throughout the program, we ensure that each stage builds upon the previous one, reinforcing the skills and knowledge acquired. This comprehensive approach prepares our students to emerge as well-rounded leaders capable of making a significant positive impact on their peers and the wider community.
