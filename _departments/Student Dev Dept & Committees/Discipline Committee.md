SACSS implements Restorative Practices (RP) as part of its disciplinary approach. The aim of RP is to facilitate meetings among victims, offenders, and community members interested in addressing the offense and finding a resolution. This approach is underpinned by Affect Theory (Tomkins, 1992) and Reintegrative Shaming Theory (Braithwaite, 1989).

  

The primary technique of RP is dialogue and conferencing. These processes allow for an appropriate response to the student's misconduct, fostering healing, forgiveness, and reducing tensions between the victim and the offender. Moreover, they heighten the errant student’s awareness of the impact of their actions, providing an opportunity for them to take responsibility while engaging their support systems.

  

At SACSS, we hold a deep respect for our students and their potential for growth in both cognitive and social realms, thereby aiming to prevent the recurrence of behavioral issues. We view the student’s family as a valuable resource and actively involve them in our efforts. Our disciplinary team frequently invites parents to Student Support Meetings, where we collaboratively explore ways to enhance students' learning experiences and overall development.
