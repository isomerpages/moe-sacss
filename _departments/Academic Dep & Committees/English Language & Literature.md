In Singapore, English is the common language that facilitates bonding among various ethnic and cultural groups. At the global level, English allows us to tap into a knowledge-based economy where English is the main _lingua franca_ of the internet, of science and technology, and of world trade. In the study of Literature, students become aware of the range of perspectives we, human beings, are capable of developing, promoting awareness and empathy in the next generation. In developing a habit of close reading, students learn to appreciate the nuances and layers of meaning in texts around them. Finally, in paying attention to the impact of language on thoughts and feelings, students are sensitive to the moments in a text that call for deeper reflection and processing, leading to the acknowledgement of different perspectives and to convince others of their own interpretations.

The English Language and Literature (EL/Lit) Department aims to develop our learners into Empathetic Communicators, Discerning Readers and Creative Inquirers. These competencies are developed through the explicit instruction of skills and knowledge to build a strong foundation in the language, and exposure to a rich language environment. As part of the Literature curriculum, students get to showcase their learning in alternative ways like composing poems, reflecting on a text, diary entries, and even short performances.

To nurture students in EL/Lit beyond the classroom, students can look forward to mini-debate competitions during EL lessons, the creation of video blogs to showcase their presentation skills and the exposure to a wide variety of authentic texts to support their learning. For students with a deep interest in exploring their EL/Lit talent, they can take part in competitions like the National Schools Literature Festival, specialised training with professionals to hone their presentation skills, and attend workshops conducted by local writers and playwrights to engage in a dialogue of their works.
