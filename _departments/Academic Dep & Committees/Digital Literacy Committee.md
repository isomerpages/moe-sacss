# DIGITAL LITERACY COMMITTEE

As part of the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) launched in 2020, students will be taught digital literacies that will enable them to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to be future ready. The committee aims to support the teachers in infusing digital literacies and innovation into the curriculum and the various subjects. Through this, we are confident that our students will develop the dispositions, knowledge and skills to thrive in the digital environment.

The Digital Literacy Committee enhances teaching and learning by providing strategies for teachers to facilitate self-directed and collaborative learning through the use of educational technologies like the Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), the Student Learning Space (SLS), and the Google Workspace environment.
