Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of our brand of Canossian Education. Our Foundress, St. Magdalene, strongly emphasised her educational philosophy which she called the "Formation of the Heart", where she acknowledged that feelings and affections have a strong bearing on the whole educational process for each child.

With the aim of preparing every student to be Canossians of Influence, the CCE curriculum leverages on a variety of platforms to cater to their different needs, interests and abilities. The three pillars to achieve this are the core curriculum, structures for culture-building, and platforms for experiential learning.
