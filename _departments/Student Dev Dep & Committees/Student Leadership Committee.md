# STUDENT LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE

SACSS builds leadership capabilities of our students through a school-wide approach using the Kouzes and Pozner Leadership Challenge Framework. As Canossians of Influence, we hope to motivate and work with a team to become servant leaders for the common good. 

With effect from 2021, the Student Leadership Programme has been expanded to incorporate 4 main strands, namely

*   Leadership through the Class Committee
*   Leadership in CCA
*   Leadership through Values in Action 
*   Leadership in the Student Council

Each of these strands allows our girls to gain the skills and knowledge pertaining to reflection and facilitation. Our girls will learn a variety of tools and strategies as well as participate in various platforms such as seminars and conferences hosted by other schools and NGOs.
