Integration of ICT in Secondary Education

  

In today's rapidly evolving digital world, where technology influences many aspects of our lives, integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into secondary education is essential for developing strong digital literacy skills in our students. Digital literacy involves the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that help students become confident, critical, and responsible users of digital technologies for information, communication, and problem-solving. Proficiency in ICT is crucial for success in higher education and the workforce.

  

The ICT Department aims to nurture all SACSS students to be self-directed learners, motivated to pursue and sustain areas of interest and passion responsibly. Every SACSS student is encouraged to be a committed learner while also demonstrating compassion and cheerfulness as responsible digital citizens.

  

In this environment, students CURATE, CREATE, and CONNECT.

  

CURATE – Learn to sift through vast amounts of information, evaluate its value, organize it, and make sense of it.

  

CREATE – Use various media tools to craft, modify, and combine different types of information.

  

CONNECT – Engage in the exchange of information or ideas both synchronously and asynchronously.

  

What is NDLP?

  

The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital skills to be future-ready. Under the NDLP, every secondary school student will have a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD). Students can use funds from their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

  

What Does This Mean for My Child?

  

At St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School, every student will use a Chromebook as their Personal Learning Device (PLD) to support their learning throughout the 4 to 5 years of education. They are expected to bring their Chromebooks home to continue learning independently and complete their assignments.

  

PLDs enhance teaching and learning by allowing teachers to use e-Pedagogy to create engaging learning experiences. They enable students to learn online according to their needs and interests and collaborate with each other anytime and anywhere. Additionally, PLDs provide an immersive environment for students to develop the dispositions, knowledge, and skills to thrive in the digital world.

  

Students will use various platforms, such as the MOE Student Learning Space (SLS) and Google Suite for Education. They can also create digital notes and organize their learning and resources productively.

  

Why a Chromebook?

  

A Chromebook is a computing device running Chrome OS as its operating system. It is designed primarily for internet use, with most applications and data stored online.

  

The Chromebook is chosen for the following reasons:

  

*   Price: Significantly less expensive than the average laptop.
    
*   Security: Strong management and control access through the Chromebook Management Console.
    
*   Weight: Lightweight, portable, and easy to carry around.
    
*   Battery: Long battery life.
    
*   Speed: Powers up and is ready to use within seconds.
    
*   By integrating ICT into our curriculum, we ensure our students are well-prepared for the opportunities and challenges of the future.
