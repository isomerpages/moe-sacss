**Mathematics Department**

Our Mathematics curriculum follows the MOE’s Mathematics Curriculum Framework, aiming to equip students with a strong foundation in concepts and skills for solving mathematical problems, developing critical mathematical processes and meta-cognitive skills, and fostering positive attitudes towards Mathematics. We strive to provide authentic and differentiated learning experiences tailored to students' needs, nurturing them to be independent learners and critical thinkers who exhibit resilience in problem-solving.

  

Our Mathematics programme builds a strong foundation through experiences that emphasize conceptual understanding using manipulatives and EdTech tools. The development of 21st century competencies in students is enhanced through opportunities to apply concepts and skills in real-world contexts and communicate their reasoning and conclusions in mathematical language. The department adopts a balanced assessment approach. Besides summative assessments, teachers also use formative assessments to evaluate students’ understanding and provide timely feedback on their progress. Lower secondary students who show a good aptitude in Mathematics may progress to study Additional Mathematics, while those interested in business and finance may choose to study Principles of Accounts in Upper Secondary.

  

Students are given the opportunity to participate in competitions to enrich their learning of Mathematics. Secondary 2 students can sign up for Mathematical Olympiad training workshops and take part in the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Junior). Secondary 1 to 3 students can also participate in the ICAS Assessment (Mathematics). Workshops such as ‘Design Thinking in Mathematics’ allow students to apply classroom learning in new contexts and be innovative in problem-solving.
