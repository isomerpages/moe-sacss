**Aesthetics Department**

  

St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School (SACSS), the Aesthetics Department offers two main strands: Life Arts and Performing Arts. Through interactive and experiential learning, students cultivate Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and 21st Century (21CC) skills, fostering innovation, collaboration, and the exploration of new passions.

Life Arts subjects such as Art, Food Consumer Education (FCE), Nutrition & Food Science (NFS), and Design & Technology (D&T) emphasize creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. SACSS's Visual Arts program aims to instill an appreciation for Art in daily life, enhancing students’ visual literacy and aesthetic sensitivity. Similarly, Design & Technology provides practical skills and concept knowledge under expert guidance. At the same time, Food and Consumer Education promotes health-conscious consumerism and prepares students for further studies in the culinary & F&B fields.

Students are encouraged to explore their interests in Life Arts through the Junior Chef Culinary Competition for FCE, external SYF Art competitions, and D&T Enrichment Workshops covering software programs and real-world skills. Interest Group Workshops also offer additional avenues for creative expression. FCE & NFS programs assist students in planning healthy and nutritious meals for wellness, while sustainability activities allow them to apply their learning in practice.

The SACSS Performing Arts Education (PfE) fosters an appreciation for the arts while honing essential 21CC skills such as self-confidence, adaptive thinking, and effective communication. Music instruction spans from basic theory to mastery of instruments like guitar, keyboard, cajon, and Jam Band, while Drama explores various dramatic presentations and communication skills thematically.

Exciting activities beyond the core curriculum include exposure to different performing art forms, live performances, and opportunities to showcase talents at school and public platforms. The Niche Class Program prepares students for advanced pursuits in Drama/Music, with masterclasses, competitions, and exchange programs expanding their horizons. SACSS nurtures holistic development, fostering students’ diverse interests and talents in the arts and beyond.
