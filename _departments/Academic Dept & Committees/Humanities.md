The Humanities Department is committed to fostering 21st century competencies in students, focusing on dispositions and competencies essential for success in today's world. Through a student-centered, inquiry-based approach, we empower learners to develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a lifelong love of the Humanities. Our dedicated educators employ a wide range of teaching strategies, including experiential learning and innovative lessons, to spark curiosity and engage students in meaningful ways. We strive to cultivate critical thinking, civic literacy, and global awareness through innovative lessons. Our curriculum further empowers students to apply their acquired skills through Alternative Assessment tasks, framed by current affairs and social issues, both locally and internationally.
