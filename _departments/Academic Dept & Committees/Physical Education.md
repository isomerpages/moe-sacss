**The SACSS Physical Education (PE) Department**

The SACSS Physical Education (PE) Department aims to develop our students' physical, mental, emotional, and psychosocial well-being through a systematic modular PE program framed by the Games Concept Approach (GCA) and the Sports Education Model. Students learn the skills and concepts of various games and gain knowledge and skills in Physical Health and Fitness (PHF) and Outdoor Education (OE). The SACSS PE program aims to instill a greater appreciation for healthy living and the outdoors, fostering a positive attitude toward physical activities.

Students are taught a variety of games categorised into invasion, net/wall, striking/fielding, target, and skills-based games. Through sports like handball, softball, and volleyball, students learn collaboration and team spirit. At the end of each module, students receive a grade based on their skills and gameplay. Additionally, students participate in an online quiz to assess their understanding of the skills and concepts learned.

The department also organizes two school-wide events: Jogathon and Sports Day. Jogathon, our annual cross-country event, provides an opportunity for students to come together as a class and compete in long-distance running. Parents are invited to participate in the staff/parents race, allowing them to engage with the school and bond with their daughters. Our annual Sports Day usually held at stadiums features students competing in shorter distance races and team events, ultimately vying to become champion classes.

These activities aim to promote healthy living, teamwork, and school spirit among our students, ensuring a well-rounded physical education experience.
