**Science Department**

  

Our school's Science curriculum follows the MOEâ€™s Science Curriculum Framework and uses the Scientific Inquiry Approach to meet national and international standards. The goal is to help students become independent, critical thinkers who are curious and have a positive attitude towards Science. By learning Secondary Science, students will gain important knowledge and skills across various Science subjects, helping them understand, remember, and apply concepts in real-life situations.

  

The Science Department aims to provide unique and engaging learning experiences. Students participate in investigations and experiments in realistic settings, learning both in classrooms and through collaboration with their peers. Wet and dry lab sessions enhance classroom teaching, and special programs encourage a spirit of inquiry and ethical behavior, nurturing future scientists.

  

We believe that learning Science goes beyond the classroom. Outdoor experiences like exploring biospheres in Science Gardens, walking the Ecological Trail, and playing in the Science Playground make Science come to life. Collaborations with organizations like South East CDC, NEA, NParks, and the Science Centre allow students to join workshops and competitions. Field trips to places like the Singapore Science Centre and NEWater Visitor Centre provide hands-on learning adventures.

  

The Science Research Programme (SRP) helps students develop skills such as critical thinking, communication, data analysis, and problem-solving. Students do hands-on experiments, fieldwork, and independent research projects to deepen their understanding of scientific concepts and methods. Activities immerse passionate students in roles like 'Interpol' or 'CSI investigators,' and competitions like the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, the International Biomedical Olympiad, and the IgNITE Science Challenge give them a chance to showcase their talents.

  
  
  
  
  

**Young Scholars Research and Initiated Programme**

Science

The Science Research Programme offers a challenging and enriching experience for students who love science and want to explore research. It encourages curiosity, creativity, and a passion for learning, helping students develop essential skills for their future academic and professional lives.

  

Students work closely with school-based mentors to conduct their own experiments and projects. This hands-on experience helps them develop critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a deeper understanding of scientific concepts.

  

Students can participate in competitions like the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair and the International Biomedical Olympiad to showcase their talents. They can also present their findings in various formats such as reports, presentations, and posters. This helps them communicate their ideas effectively and prepares them for future academic and professional endeavors.
