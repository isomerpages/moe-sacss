Mother Tongue Department at SACSS

At SACSS, the Mother Tongue Department is dedicated to creating a positive and supportive environment where students can learn and appreciate their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Our goal is to help each student become a confident and effective communicator while encouraging reflection and critical thinking. Here's how we integrate 21st Century skills into our curriculum and pedagogical approaches:

Personalized Learning and Support

We know that every MTL learner is unique, with different starting points and learning needs. By building on each student’s prior knowledge and language abilities, we focus on improving their speaking and writing skills. Our dedicated teachers design customized learning packages and tools to support each student's journey. Using ICT tools, we encourage collaboration and interaction, making learning meaningful and engaging.

Collaborative and Real-World Learning

Teamwork is a key part of our curriculum. Students work in groups on projects and activities that involve solving real-world problems. This approach helps students apply what they learn to real-life situations and develop important life skills like teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability.

Authentic and Experiential Learning

We want MTL learning to be meaningful and authentic for every student. Our curriculum includes partnerships with external institutions and the community, giving students the chance to learn from professionals in different language-related fields when such opportunities are available. For example, we had invited experts to share insights on voice projection and their work and organized learning journeys to Mediacorp , providing practical, real-world applications of language skills. 

Cultural Appreciation and Global Perspective

Understanding and appreciating cultural roots is essential for developing a global perspective. Our programs include field trips, cultural performances, and activities that help students connect with their cultural heritage. These experiences not only improve their language skills but also foster a deep appreciation for cultural diversity.

Emphasis on Critical Thinking and Communication

Effective communication and critical thinking are central to our pedagogical approach. Through presentations and group discussions, students practice expressing their thoughts clearly and confidently. This helps them develop the critical skills needed to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world.

At SACSS, the Mother Tongue Department is committed to creating meaningful and authentic learning experiences. By integrating 21st Century competencies into our curriculum and teaching methods, we ensure that our students are well-prepared to seize the opportunities and embrace the possibilities the future brings.
