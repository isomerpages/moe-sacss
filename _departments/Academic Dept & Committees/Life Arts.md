Life Arts subjects include Art, Food Consumer Education (FCE) for lower secondary, Nutrition & Food Science (NFS) for upper secondary, and Design & Technology (D&T). These subjects promote creativity and innovation in our students through their products and designs creation. Other than cultivating an appreciation for the subjects, these subjects also develop our students to be critical-thinkers and problem solvers.

The SACSS Visual Arts programme aims to educate students to appreciate the beauty of art in their daily lives and to communicate their ideas through the use of different art forms. Through the learning of art, students develop visual literacy which enables them to observe and perceive the world with increased awareness and aesthetic sensitivity. Next, the Design & Technology curriculum allows students to acquire related concept knowledge and practical skills through the use of hand tools, equipment and machines. Under the guidance and supervision of the teachers and the workshop technician, students are able to materialise their creative designs. Thirdly, the curriculum for Food and Consumer Education (FCE) at the lower secondary levels is designed to encourage students to be health-conscious and discerning consumers; enabling them to better manage their everyday lives for the present and future. This foundational knowledge and skills allow progression to the upper secondary levels where the students pursue an in-depth study on nutrition and health, food science, and food literacy when they take up the Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) subject. 

Students have opportunities to pursue their varied interests in the Life Arts. The Creative Arts Programme aims to provide platforms to stretch students who have the talent, passion and interest for the visual arts. They experiment on other art forms and mediums that are not taught during lessons. This group of students represents the school for external art competitions. D&T Enrichment Workshops train students on software programmes like the Sketchup programme, which is a 3D modelling tool that creates accurate working drawings, and Microbit programming, which helps students learn the real world industrial skills of prototyping and testing. Interest Groups Workshops also provide opportunities for students to bake cakes or cookies for special occasions like Mothers’ Day or Fathers’ Day, make cards or jewelries for themselves or their loved ones.
