SACSS Jogathon is happening on 25 May 2023. Running a race takes a lot of training, effort, and determination; the same qualities needed to succeed in life. Likewise, we want to instill this mindset in all our girls to make them ready to
face the future. We hope that parents will run with your daughters at our annual Jogathon and show your support by taking part in the SACSS Parentsâ€™ Race this year.

Please refer to the full details on the Parents Gateway platform.
